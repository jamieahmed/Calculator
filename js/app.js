/*
 * Instructions: You've been given the HTML template for a JavaScript  
 * calculator. Implement functionality such that when two numbers are
 * entered in the input fields, pressing one of the 'operator' buttons
 * results in the mathematical calculation for those two numbers.
 * 
 * For example: If the boxes contain 4 and 2, pressing the "+" button should 
 * display the number 6. If the "-" button is pressed, 2 should be displayed.
 * If the "*" button is pressed, 8 should be displayed. If the "/" button
 * is pressed, 2 should be displayed.
 * 
 * There are bounuses as well:
 * EASY BONUS:  If the result is odd, change it's color to salmon.
 * MEDIUM BONUS:  Use a single event listener to accomplish this task, rather
 * than 5 of them.
